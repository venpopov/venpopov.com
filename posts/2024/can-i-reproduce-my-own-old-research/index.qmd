I recently \[bemoaned my descent into madness\](../reproducibility-is-hard/index.qmd) trying to achieve perfect computational reproducibility. I occasionally have issues reproducing back-burner projects, but I have surmised that my failing there is usually the excitement of finding this out overruling the good coding practices I *know* I should follow.

But what about published project - projects for which I have shared the final code and data publicly. If anyone were in the best position to reproduce them, that would be me. Conversely... well, you know.

It is by now well documented that while papers who share their analysis code publicly are much more likely to be reproducible \[REFERENCE\].

As I noted in my previous post....

I made an 1h video recording. Edit it an post it.

First step: Clone the repository

Done.

We notice the R version. 3.4.3. Will it work? Well Rig could help us but let's try it like it is now

r\$\> vhsv \<- t(rgb2hsv(t(select(vrgb, -color)), maxColorValue = 1)) Error in select(vrgb, -color) : unused argument (-color)

hmm?

did this not happen last time?

two solutions:

-   explicit call

-   conflicted package (haven't used it before)

plot_ly(vrgb, x=\~r, y=\~g, z=\~b, color=\~id, type="scatt er3d", mode="markers", marker=list(color=vrgb\$color, size=20)) Error in unique.default(x) : unique() applies only to vectors

let's try to get an older version of the plotly package

Can you get a renv.lock file from a session.info() output????

there is a bug in Vmisc::pkg_vload - if installation did not go through, it gives an error "package doesnt exist or sth like it

Error in `vec_assign()`: ! Can't convert `replace$col` <double> to match type of `data$col` <character>. Run `rlang::last_trace()` to see where the error occurred.

When I google this error I get this funny result, perfect for a lecture or a blog post

Can't reproduce simulation 2 numbers:

-   mean(unlist(prank)) \[1\] 0.781033

possible causes

-   different R

-   I messed up with copy paste

-   different operating system different random seed, etc.

-   difference in one of the underlying packages

Before the class with the students tomorrow:

-   restore plotly to old version

-   delete some of the packages I was missing

Point out bad practice with RData
