About me

</h2>

I am a tenured [Senior Scientist in Computational Modeling of Behavior](https://www.psychology.uzh.ch/en/areas/nec/compmod/popov.html) at the Department of Psychology, University of Zürich. I completed my PhD in Cognitive Psychology from Carnegie Mellon University under Prof. Lynne Reder in 2020, and until 2023 I was a postdoctoral researcher with Prof. Klaus Oberauer at the University of Zürich. My research has been awarded with the [2025 Bertelson Early Career Award](https://www.escop.eu/awards-en-funding/past-award-recipients/bertelson-award) from the European Society for Cognitive Psychology and the [2021 Glushko Dissertation Prize](https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/glushko-dissertation-prize/) from the Cognitive Science Society. I am also a consulting editor at the [Memory & Cognition](https://link.springer.com/journal/13421/editors).

I use computational modeling to understand the structure, organization, and function of fundamental cognitive processes, to refine the development and evaluation of psychological theories, and to improve psychological measurement.

I publish under my full name, Vencislav Popov, but Ven is easier to say and remember, and as people have noted, “Oh, Ven, like a Venn diagram!”

## Research interests

My current research focus is on how to improve inference in psychological science to resolve the theory crisis. To that aim I develop mechanistic models that specify theoretical assumptions about how psychological processes produce behavior. So far I have done that mostly in my own field of human memory to understand how limited cognitive resources affect memory strength, but I am eager to extend such approaches to other non-cognitive phenomena. To strengthen the evaluation of theoretical models, I develop techniques for improving psychological measurement and new standards for model evaluation. To make measurement models accessible for everyone, I develop flexible and easy to use hierarchical Bayesian implementations in R. I am committed to open science, and I am strong advocate for Bayesian inference.

Several goals drive my research program, including:

-   developing comprehensive computational models of human memory
-   understanding how people control limited cognitive resources
-   developing and evaluating new methods for measuring cognitive processes
-   developing new methods and tools for computational modeling of behavior
-   applying computational modeling in non-cognitive areas of psychology
-   measuring theoretical knowledge accumulation in psychology
-   addressing the theory crisis in psychology
